            <p>
                My interests center around spending time with my girlfriend and sharing music with her by playing guitar. I also enjoy outdoor activities, particularly bike riding, which lets me connect with nature while staying active. These interests reflect my appreciation for both meaningful relationships and staying active outdoors
